# Chess 
A game of chess has several kinds of pieces: pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. 
These pieces are arranged on a chessboard as shown in the figure [here](https://374999-1254560-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/knight-chess-piece-starting-moves.jpg).

## Rules
- A cell on the board is specified by a (row, column) tuple: rows increasing from bottom to top and columns increasing from left to right. Traditionally the black pieces are arranged in the top two rows as shown. 

- Each chess piece can move in a specific way. In addition to moving, each chess piece can also kill a chess piece of the opposite color if it moves to its place.

## Pieces
There are 6 main pieces in chess:
- Queen: worth 9 points.
- Rook: worth 5 points.
- Bishop: worth 3 points.
- Knight: worth 3 points.
- Pawn: worth 1 point.
- King: worth infinity points.

## Problem Statement
The main goal is to find the best move in a given chess position. You should output in the following format i.e piece name + square it should move. For example, Kingd1 (king moves to square d1) and Queenf3 (queen moves to square f3).
